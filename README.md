C++ Work
In this application the code takes input from the user and calculates how much interest they will make with a deposit they enter over the course of however many years they enter with the amount of interest they enter. It shows both with monthly deposits indicated by the user and without. 
I believe I did well on this project, however it could have been more compact. There are a lot of oppurtunities for me to grow as a programmer and looking back I see where I could have put several things in different files to make things tidier. Overall I'm proud of the work I did. 
I found the calculation aspect of this code to be the most challenging. I asked a friend for help and used tutors to overcome this obstical. In the end I got it done and the calcuation compiled correctly. A great feeling. 
I think that everything from this project can be used moving forward. This is the least help I've needed on a project which really boosted my confidence. Making constructors has finally clicked after this project.
I made this code as readable as I knew how at the time, again looking back I see where I could improve. I seperated my code by functions to be called which helped organize and can be edited at a later date. It would be fairly simple to take class I created and segment it into files to further improve readability.
